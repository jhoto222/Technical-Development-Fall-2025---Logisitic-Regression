# Technical-Development-Fall-2025---Logisitic-Regression
I created this project for AIS members to complete for Professional Development Points. It guides students through performing logistic regression using Jupyter Notebook.
AIS Pro Points: Logistic Regression in Jupyter

Logistic Regression Breast Cancer Classification

Built for: AIS Professional Development Program
Tools: Python, Jupyter Notebook, scikit-learn, pandas, seaborn

🌟 Project Overview

This project builds a logistic regression model to predict whether a tumor is benign or malignant using the Breast Cancer Wisconsin Diagnostic Dataset.
Members learned how to prepare data, scale numerical features, train a model, and evaluate results — a core workflow used in real-world machine learning pipelines.

I designed this project to help AIS members gain hands-on experience with applied machine learning in a way that is beginner-friendly and replicable.

🎯 Key Skills Demonstrated

Data cleaning & preprocessing

Converting categorical labels to numerical values

Feature scaling using StandardScaler

Training a LogisticRegression model in scikit-learn

Evaluating accuracy using train/test split

🚀 Results

The trained model achieved an accuracy of ~98% on the test set.

Accuracy: 0.982

🧠 Dataset
